    <h1>Changes in Avidemux v2.7.8 â€“ v2.?.?</h1>

    <h2>Behavior</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The part of video preceding the presentation time of the first frame
          is now excluded from created segment, making all videos appear as if
          they &quot;start at zero&quot;.</li>
      <li>When saving video, the frame matching the B marker is now excluded
          from the exported range. Therefore, if the B marker is set to the last
          frame of the video, it needs to be reset to the full duration for the
          last frame to be included into the output.</li>
      <li>Loading Matroska files with HEVC video tracks takes longer as slice
          headers are decoded to detect the frame type.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>New Video Filters</h2>

      <li>In the Video Filter Manager, active filters can be temporarily disabled.</li>
      <li>Preference added to load sequentially named pictures in reverse order,
          allowing to reverse video by exporting selection as JPEG images and
