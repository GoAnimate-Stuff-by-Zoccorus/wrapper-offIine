    <h1>Changes in Avidemux v2.7.6 â€“ v2.7.8</h1>

    <h2>New Features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Many new video filters added by courtesy of
          <a href="https://github.com/szlldm">szlldm</a>.</li>
      <li>A dedicated MOV muxer is now available, replacing silent fallback to
          MOV muxing mode within the MP4 muxer.</li>
      <li>A subset of color info relevant for HDR support is retained in copy
          mode when both input and output video are stored in Matroska / WebM
          containers. Settings to add or override color info have been added to
          MKV and WebM muxers.</li>
      <li>The indexer in the MPEG-TS demuxer now detects resolution changes in
          MPEG-2 and H.264 streams which are entirely unsupported and suggests
          aborting indexing. If the user chooses to continue, it records file
          offsets of all resolution changes to the log. This allows advanced
          users to split the file at these offsets using other tools like
          <em>head</em> and <em>tail</em> into chunks which can be processed
          with Avidemux.</li>
      <li>YUV varieties of the lossless Ut Video codec are supported now for
          decoding and encoding via bundled FFmpeg libraries.</li>
      <li>Uncompressed 24-bit audio is now supported for a subset of file formats.</li>
      <li>Limited support for 7.1 channel layout.</li>
      <li>Decode and stream copy support for XLL substream in DTS audio tracks.</li>
      <li>Audio properties are now updated on resuming playback. This allows to
          start saving after an audio format change. When audio format changes
          during playback, the FFmpeg-based audio decoder will output silence
          and keep format rather than producing garbage.</li>
      <li>An option to keep the identity of markers A and B instead of swapping
          them automatically has been added to Preferences.</li>
      <li>The keyboard shortcut for "Delete" action has been made customizable
          with alternative keyboard shortcuts enabled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Other Enhancements</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Multi-threaded video decoding is now available for the bundled FFmpeg.
          On powerful multi-core CPUs, this can drastically improve decoding
          performance. A maximum of 8 threads can be created, but a conservative
          custom upper limit of 4 is recommended. Values above 8 cause decoding
          failures. Multi-threaded decoding and HW accelerated decoding are
          mutually exclusive, changes require application restart to have
          effect.</li>
      <li>The maximum supported resolution has been increased to 8192x8192</li>
      <li>The bundled FFmpeg has been updated to the 4.2.4 release.</li>
      <li>Non-standard display aspect ratios can be configured in MP4 muxer by
          specifying display width.</li>
      <li>MP4 muxer accepts now MPEG-1 and MPEG-2.</li>
      <li>The configuration dialog of the x265 video encoder plugin enjoyed
          massive cleanup and refactoring by
          <a href="https://github.com/xyzzy42">Trent Piepho</a>, more Adaptive
          Quatization Variance methods have been added.</li>
      <li>Python interface has been substantially extended, includes now methods
          to query segment properties, the number and filenames of loaded
          videos, PTS of keyframes, methods to seek to time with preview
          updated, to open file dialogs filtered by extension and a built-in
          method to split filename extension from a given path.</li>
      <li>Scripting shell now supports unicode characters.</li>
      <li>On macOS, files can be loaded via Finder context menu or by dropping
          them onto Avidemux icon in the dock.</li>
      <li>On Linux, Jobs GUI and the CLI executable can be launched from
          AppImage by creating a symlink with _jobs or _cli in filename
          respectively and running the AppImage via this symlink.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bugfixes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Rate control was broken in some video encoders, especially in VP9 and
          in NVENC-based encoders, fixed now.</li>
      <li>Multiple issues in cut point checks for H.264 and HEVC streams in copy
          mode, leading to incorrect check results, were identified and
          resolved.</li>
      <li>The first two frames of external AC3 or EAC3 audio tracks are not
          dropped anymore. This regression from enhanced protection against
          false positives, added 3 years ago, has been finally identified and
          fixed.</li>
      <li>Indexing of MPEG-TS files with HEVC video was broken when video stream
          lacked access unit delimiters. The issue was identified and fixed
          right after 2.7.7 had been tagged as released and is the reason why
          version 2.7.7 was superseded by 2.7.8.</li>
      <li>VU meter was grossly ahead of audio output on Windows, now it is just
          a tiny little bit ahead.</li>
      <li>Numerous other fixes and overall polish.</li>
    </ul>
